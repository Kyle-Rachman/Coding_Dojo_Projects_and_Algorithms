This project will consist of 3 members:
    Evan Schultz, Kyle Rachman, David Kral
    Evan and David will be handling the back end, Kyle will be handling the front end.

The MVP of this project:
    This project will implement CRUD in the user database.
    This project will implement CRUD in the interests database in a many-to-many connection in SQL.
    This project will allow users to select their interests.
    Every 24 hours, the project pulls in the latest journals into the database, and emails them to the users. 
    The API will return a list of 5-10 of those interests, provide a summary, and a link.

Future features if time allows:
    If interest is inactive for >24 hours, stop pulling summaries and adding to database.
    If debug = true, ignore above, check if database has things for that interest within the last 24 hours, if it doesn't run.
